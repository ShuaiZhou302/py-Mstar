A-python-implementation of basic M* algorithm <br>
This project is a replication of the methods described in the paper "[Subdimensional expansion for multirobot path planning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370214001271)"<br>
The maps and scenarios used inside this repo come from [MAPF Benchmark](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf/index.html)<br>
Just implementing basic M* for my own use, recursiveM* and others variant would be uploaded later.
