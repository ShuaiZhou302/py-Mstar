A-python-implementation of basic M* algorithm
This project is a replication of the methods described in the paper "[Subdimensional expansion for multirobot path planning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370214001271)". The code implements the algorithm proposed in the paper and verifies its effectiveness through experiments.
